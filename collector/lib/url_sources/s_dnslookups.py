"""Look up many names in the DNS, via proxies.

Four command-line arguments are expected:

 * A list of location specifications in the same format as `capture`.
 * A list of DNS server IP addresses, classified by location: each line
   of the form

   LOCATION  IP IP IP ...

   where LOCATION also appears in the location-specifications file.
   (Locations in either file that don't appear in the other will be
   ignored, so you can disable a location by commenting it out in
   either file.)  Each IP on the line for LOCATION will be queried via
   the proxy for LOCATION.

 * A list of hostnames to look up, one per line.  This file may be
   gzipped.  If it is, the output files will also be gzipped.

 * The name of the output directory, which will be created if it
   doesn't exist.  All output is to files named

       output_dir/YYYY-MM-DD.N/LOCATION.IP.dns(.gz)
