"""Capture the HTML content and a screenshot of each URL in a list,
using PhantomJS, from many locations simultaneously.

Locations are defined by the config file passed as an argument, which
is line- oriented, each line having the general form

  locale method arguments ...

'locale' is an arbitrary word (consisting entirely of lowercase ASCII
letters) which names the location.

'method' selects a general method for capturing pages from this
location.  Subsequent 'arguments' are method-specific.  There are
currently two supported methods:

  direct: The controller machine will issue HTTP requests directly.
          No arguments.

  ovpn:   HTTP requests will be proxied via openvpn.
          One or more arguments are passed to the 'openvpn-netns'
          helper program (see scripts/openvpn-netns.c).  The initial
          argument is treated as a glob pattern which should expand to
          one or more OpenVPN config files; if there's more than one,
          they are placed in a random order and then used round-robin
          (i.e. if connection with one config file fails or drops, the
          next one is tried).

The second non-optional argument is the list of URLs to process, one per
line.

The third non-optional argument is the directory in which to store
results.  Each result will be written to its own file in this
directory; the directory hierarchy has the structure

  ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${RUN}/AB/CDE/FGH.${LOCALE}

where RUN starts at zero and is incremented by one each time the program is
invoked, and AB,CDE,FGH is a 8-digit decimal number assigned to each URL.
This number is not meaningful; you must look in each file to learn which
URL goes with which result.

The output files are binary; see CaptureResult.write_result for the format.
