"""Extract URLs from Twitter streams.

You can choose to examine the stream of a single user, a snowball
sample of all users within some follow-graph distance of one user, or
a frontier sample of users from the entire population.  Or you can
examine a random sample of all tweets, filtered with search
parameters."""
